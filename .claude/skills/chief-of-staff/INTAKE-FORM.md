## Preferences & Quirks

**Things that stress you out (I'll prioritize preventing these):**
I don't play close attention to my email, I leave things unread when I'm not ready to act on them. I want to make sure I'm not missing an priority action for billing, school, etc. 

There are many other random tasks that build up: 
Planning vacations, 
Vet appointments
Personal doctor appoitments 

**Things you don't want to think about (I'll handle proactively):**
Cleaning up email from spam and things not worth reading. Can update my filter system to improve the focused inbox. 

**Any recurring conflicts or pain points to solve:**


**Communication pet peeves (what to avoid):**
